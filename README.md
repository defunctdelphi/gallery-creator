# Files and Folders Tree Builder

Simple Delphi program for batch-creating large number of photo miniatures. It includes also a quite complex file rename engine, so you can flexibly set file names of created destination files. Unfortunately, form file for window, where you set file rename pattern, is binnary and I wasn't able to translate it (without Delphi -- see below).

You can use this project as either a tool, to convert large number of `.jpg` files to their respective `.gif` miniatures, with optional resize. Or you can it's source code as an example for parsing all files in given directory and/or JPG-to-GIF conversion or image resize example. Keep in mind, that both comments and names (variables, object) are in Polish. I didn't find enough time and determination to translated them as well. I only tranlsated strings.

**You're only getting project's source code and nothing else! You need to find all missing Delphi components by yourself.**

### Status

Last time `.dpr` file saved in Delphi: **11 May 2003**. Last time `.exe` file built: **12 October 2005**.

**This project ABANDONED! There is no wiki, issues and no support. There will be no future updates. Unfortunately, you're on your own.**

I don't have access to either most of my components used in this or any other of my Delphi projects, nor to Delphi itself. Even translation of this project to English was done by text-editing all `.dfm` and `.pas` files and therefore it may be cracked. It was made in hope to be useful to anyone and for the same reason I'm releasing its source code, but you're using this project or source code at your own responsibility.
