# Files and Folders Tree Builder

Simple Delphi program for batch-creating large number of photo miniatures.

### Status

Last time `.dpr` file saved in Delphi: **11 May 2003**. Last time `.exe` file built: **12 October 2005**.

**This project ABANDONED! There is no wiki, issues and no support. There will be no future updates. Unfortunately, you're on your own.**

I don't have access to either most of my components used in this or any other of my Delphi projects, nor to Delphi itself. Even translation of this project to English was done by text-editing all `.dfm` and `.pas` files and therefore it may be cracked. It was made in hope to be useful to anyone and for the same reason I'm releasing its source code, but you're using this project or source code at your own responsibility.
